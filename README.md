Build Environment for RPM Based Packages (OpenSUSE, Fedora, CentOS and Mageia)
==============================================================================

This is a template that contains all the dependencies for building software using `./build-in-docker.sh` from [development/bootstrap-build-environment](https://mrw.sh/development/bootstrap-build-environment). This speeds up the builds.

The `master` branch is not used, but the specific branches, such as `amd64-opensuse-leap` to build for OpenSuSE Leap on amd64 hardware.
